## Weight Initialization Techniques

### 1. **Random Normal Initialization**
Weights are initialized with random values from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a specified standard deviation.

### 2. **Random Uniform Initialization**
Weights are initialized from a uniform distribution within a specified range.

### 3. **Glorot Uniform (Xavier) Initialization**
Glorot Uniform initialization helps to maintain the variance of activations across layers by scaling the weights based on the input and output dimensions.

### 4. **He Normal Initialization**
He Normal is designed for layers using ReLU activation, scaling the weights by a factor based on the number of input units.

### 5. **He Uniform Initialization**
Similar to He Normal but uses a uniform distribution for weight initialization.

### 6. **LeCun Normal Initialization**
LeCun Normal initialization is recommended for `tanh` activations, scaling the weights by a factor based on the input dimensions.

### 7. **Zeros Initialization**
Weights are initialized to zero. This is typically used for biases, not for hidden layers.

### 8. **Ones Initialization**
Weights are initialized to one, although this is rarely used for standard deep learning models.
